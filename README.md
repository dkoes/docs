# Koes Research Group
#### Removing barriers to computational drug discovery one bit at a time
This repository contains the collected wisdom of the research group.
Hopefully the total amount of wisdom (including uncollected) is much larger.

* [Contributing to these docs](GIT.md)
* [Getting connected](CONNECTING.md)
* [Setting up your linux environment](SETUP.md)
* [Using the department cluster](CLUSTER.md)
* [Running molecular dynamics](MD.md)
* [Creating a poster](POSTERS.md)


## General logistics
* There is a weekly group meeting where one person presents a paper and a subset of people share recent results
* There are weekly one-on-one meetings
* Everyone should be subscribed to the [Koes Group Slack Team](http://koesgroup.slack.com)
* All communication is over slack.  Try to prefer #help over direct messages.
* Full-time researchers provide daily status reports over slack via the Howdy bot.  Following agile stand-up meeting conventions, there are two questions.
  * What did you do yesterday
  * What did you do today (answer should include if there is anything you are blocked on)
