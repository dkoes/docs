# Posters

* Somone should be able to get the basic idea of the project from reading the poster, but you do not have to provide all the details - the poster is there to be a visual aid for your in-person presentation.
* All structures from pymol should be ray traced and saved to high resolution pngs (e.g. `ray 1200,1600`).  Avoid jpeg and other lossy image formats.
* If organizing text into boxes, do not have separate boxes for the border, the title, and the body of the text.  Make it all one box so the text moves together and is properly aligned.
* Generally do not want font size to be below 24pt. References and some figure captions might be exceptions.
* One dimension is limited to at most 42"
* Horizontal (landscape) orientation is preferred 
* Powerpoint, Google Slides, InkScape, OmniGraffle are all reasonable programs to use, but none are great
* PI (dkoes) is listed last in the authors.  Do not specify Dr or PhD
* In acknowledgements reference whatever the current grant funding the group is (e.g. R01GM108340 from NIGMS)
* Limit the amount of background color to save ink.
* Pitt seal for top corners (can put other affiliated logos as well): https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fb/University_of_Pittsburgh_seal.svg
